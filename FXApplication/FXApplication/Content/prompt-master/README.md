# Prompt Font

Prompt in Thai also means ready.

Prompt is a Loopless Thai and Sans Latin typeface. This simple and geometric Latin was developed to work harmoniously with Loopless Thai that has wide proportion and airy negative space. It is suitable for any layout and communication usage such as magazine, newspaer, poster, and other print media. 

A similarity between some glyphs such as [ก ถ ภ ฤ ฦ] [ฎ ฏ] [บ ป] [ข ช] is something to take into consideration because it might lead to confusion if each glyph is not clear enough.

Formal loopless Thai tyefaces are simplified from a conservative looped Thai so this simplification has to be done properly in order to preserve the character.

Sizes and positions of vowels and tone marks need to be managed carefully because they are all relevant to readability, legibility, and overall textures.

Ttfautohint supports Thai hinting process efficiently. It is an easy-to-use tool that is highly recommended. For more information, visit http://www.freetype.org/ttfautohint/

Glyphs files (.glyphs) in the source folder can be opened in Glyphs program for further development.
